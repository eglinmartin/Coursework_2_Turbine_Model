------------1. MODEL OUTLINE------------

This model is designed to aid siting
offshore wind turbines along a stretch
of coastline, based on user-inputted
parameters.

The model takes a topography map
calculates a slope map from it, and uses
both to run a multi-criteria evaluation.
It then sites offshore wind turbines in
eligible locations in the ocean.

The user may alter the inputs to their
liking, to produce a map that works for
them.  Results can then be printed to
'data_out.txt' for further use.



-----2. INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING--------

The program was intended to be run in
the user's IDE of choice, but was
designed in Spyder using the iPython
console.  To run, run the model through
the IDE.

More detailed information can be found
in 'Manual and Development
Document.pdf'. 



--------3. DIRECTORY CONTENTS-----------

The downloaded directory includes:

- 'turbine_model.py' - the main file,
	to be opened in Spyder IDE.

- 'turbine_class.py' - auxiliary file
	containing class data.  No
	need to open to run the model.

- 'data_in.txt' - ASCII file containing
	the environment data.

- 'data_out.txt' - text file containing
	the results of the most recent
	test.

- 'licence.txt' - licence information

- 'Manual and Development Document
	.pdf' - a guide as to how to
	use the model and an outline
	of its development.
